    - A distributed and immutable digital ledger.
    - Consists of blocks linked by cryptographic hashes.
    - Decentralized: No single point of control.
    - Transparent: Anyone can view the public ledger.
    - Secure: Data once written cannot be easily changed.
    - Trustless system: No need to trust a third party.
    - Each block contains timestamp, transactions, nonce, and hash.

    - Process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain.
    - Miners solve cryptographic puzzles (Proof-of-Work).
    - Rewards include new coins and transaction fees.
    - Secures the network and maintains consensus.
    - High computational effort required (hashing).
    - Block difficulty adjusts over time.
    - Popular mining algorithms: SHA-256 (Bitcoin), Ethash (Ethereum).

    - Hashing: Converts input data into fixed-length hash (e.g., SHA-256).
    - Digital Signatures: Ensures authenticity of sender using private keys.
    - Public-Key Cryptography: Transactions signed with private key, verified with public key.
    - Merkle Tree: Hierarchical hash tree for fast verification of transactions in blocks.
    - Nonce: A number used once to achieve desired hash pattern.
    - Immutable Ledger: Tampering with one block affects all following blocks.

with st.expander("🧩 Key Terms and Definitions"):
    st.markdown("""
    **Block**: A container of data (transactions) with a unique hash and a pointer to the previous block.

    **Genesis Block**: The first block in a blockchain.

    **Ledger**: Record of all transactions; in blockchain, it is distributed and shared.

    **Node**: A computer that maintains a copy of the blockchain and validates transactions.

    **Consensus Mechanism**: Rules that nodes follow to agree on the validity of transactions (e.g., PoW, PoS).

    **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Mining algorithm where miners compete to solve complex problems.

    **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen based on stake (amount held) to validate transactions.

    **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing code on blockchain that runs when predefined conditions are met.

    **Wallet**: Digital tool to send, receive, and store cryptocurrency using public-private key pair.

    **Address**: A hashed public key used as a destination for crypto transactions.

    **Private Key**: A secret key used to sign transactions.

    **Public Key**: A key that can be shared; used to verify signatures and receive funds.

    **Transaction Fee**: Fee paid to miners/validators to prioritize and include the transaction in the block.

    **Fork**: A split in the blockchain protocol (soft fork – backward-compatible, hard fork – not compatible).

    **Exchange**: A platform to trade fiat with crypto or between cryptocurrencies.

    **Token**: A digital asset built on an existing blockchain (e.g., ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum).

    **Altcoin**: Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.

    **Stablecoin**: A crypto asset pegged to a stable value like USD (e.g., USDT, USDC).

    **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**: Unique cryptographic token representing ownership of a digital asset.

    **Cold Wallet**: Offline crypto storage method for enhanced security.

    **Hot Wallet**: Internet-connected wallet for ease of use but more vulnerable.

    **Gas**: Fee for executing operations (smart contracts, transactions) on Ethereum.

    **Blockchain Explorer**: Tool to view blockchain data like blocks, transactions, and addresses (e.g., blockchain.com).
